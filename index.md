I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2026.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 2:

    This was one of my favorite labs because it included some knowledge that I had in my past CS courses. This lab made me feel confident in my coding journey and allowed me to learn a new  coding language which was C++. I had previous experience with Java so it was interesting to see the similarities and differences in both languages.

* Lab 7:

    This was one of my favorites because I got more comfortable writing if statements and using boolean expressions. I became more familiar using the logical operators such as "||" and && which became very useful. I remember having a difficult time with one of the parking situations that had a 30 minute mark, but it was quickly resolved with the help of my instructor, partner, and online resources. 

* Lab 8, part 1:

    This lab was one of my favorites because it was very stimulating and was a challenge for both me and my partner. I believe it was a good balance because it had concepts that we were familiar with and at the same time concepts that we were still learning to grasp. With the help of my partner we got to complete the lab using our knowledge, notes, and with the help of our instructor.
